                    <h3>A Place To Unwind</h3>
                    <p>Do you seek a place to unwind and relax? A place where you can listen to relaxing music, look at beautiful scenery, all while drinking from a selection of gourmet teas? Well look no further, at Lofi Chai we service all of those needs and provide a little something extra for fans of the increasingly popular genre of music. We gladly represent ourselves as a venue for artists and host events in order to promote everything Lofi, we don’t care if it goes mainstream though, we prefer to stay underground. If you're a niche kind of customer then we’re your niche kind of place, come and check us out sometime and take a load off.</p>
